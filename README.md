# BetterLeads

A mod that allows you to use leads on more entities.

Currently, works with Merchant Entities (Villagers and Wandering Traders), most Hostile Mobs, Water Creatures (fish and
squid), turtles and pandas, you can configure which of these categories are enabled through ModMenu.

The Mobs which it doesn't work properly with are:

- Phantoms
- Ghasts
- Slimes
- Magma-cubes
- Shulkers
- Vexs
- and Bats

## Usage

Put the latest release from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterleads), [GitHub](https://github.com/quaoz/BetterLeads/releases) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterleads) in your mods folder along
with [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

## Configuration

If you are playing in singleplayer the mod can configured through ModMenu, if the mod is installed on a server it can be configured by editing the `betterleads.toml` file in the config directory.
